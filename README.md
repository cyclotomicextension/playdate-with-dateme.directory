Analysis of the highest occurring name and its frequency using dateme.directory data

# Introduction:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the highest occurring name and its frequency using data obtained from dateme.directory. The data was analyzed using Python and the resulting visualization was generated using the Matplotlib library.

# Data source:
The data used for this analysis was obtained from dateme.directory, a website that provides "long-form, earnest dating profiles for serious romantic partners."

# Methodology:

Data cleaning: The data was first cleaned to remove any duplicates or missing values or whitespaces.
Data analysis: The cleaned data was then analyzed using Python. The frequency of each name was determined and the name with the highest frequency was identified.
Visualization: A plot was generated using the Matplotlib library to visualize the frequency of the highest occurring name with scatter points representing highest frequencies.

# Results:
The highest occurring name in the dateme.directory data was "David" with a frequency of 4.

# Visualization:
A bar chart was generated to visualize the frequency of all names. The x-axis shows the names and the y-axis shows the frequencies.
